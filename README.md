### üß† Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Documenting design properties in a mockup‚Äîlike colours, fonts, and sizes‚Äîhelps bridge the gap between designers and developers. It ensures that the visual identity of the project remains **consistent**, **intentional**, and easy to replicate across different parts of the application.

Having clear specifications:
- Speeds up development by reducing guesswork  
- Enhances brand coherence across screens and devices  
- Makes future design iterations easier and more collaborative  
- Improves user experience by maintaining visual harmony
